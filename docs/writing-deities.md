# Writing Deities

A brief summary of how cultures personified writing, language, and storytelling power.

## Universal Pattern

Every civilization independently decided:

* Writing is not human.
* Storytelling is not entertainment.
* Language is a **supernatural force that controls reality**.

That belief is why nearly every culture created gods not just of knowledge — but specifically of **words, memory, and recorded truth**.
